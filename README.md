A basic web app that allows users to search for twitch streams 

Link to the live site: http://tdlogan.github.io/

The version features a basic responsive styling so it may be comfortably viewed from different window sizes. 

Rules:
[x] Write a simple web app that hits the Twitch API URL shown at the top (there are API docs online)
[x] Build the URL based on the query entered by the user in the search box shown in the mock
[x] Build out the list as shown in the mock. 
[x] All UI elements are mandatory and self-explanatory
[x] Feel free to add more/better UI, as long as you include the mandatory elements
[x] No frameworks like jQuery/AngularJS.  Just vanilla JS with XHR to hit the API.
